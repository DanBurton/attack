# Haskell Package Attack: January 2018

The monthly package attack to make things faster. Each month there is a call
for performance improvements to any random popular package of your
choosing. [The most recent announcement.](https://github.com/haskell-perf/attack/blob/master/archive/2018-jan.md)

## How does it work?

Each month there is an entry in the [archive](https://github.com/haskell-perf/attack/tree/master/archive) directory in this repo.

It's good practice for Haskell intermediates to learn Haskell
performance, and a change for advanced Haskellers to show off.

For a bit of fun/competition, **we have a monthly table/leader board**
below and it is ordered by lines of code changed. The fewer lines, the
"better".

You can also **nominate packages** that you know is
slow, that people might take a crack at. Open a PR to this repo
editing this file to add package nominations.

## Why not general library improvements too?

Some asked: why not improve docs, bugfixes, security, etc.? Because
performance can be measured trivially, and haskell-perf is all about
performance. Performance is fun, things go *faster*! Writing
documentation and fixing bugs is much harder to motivate.
